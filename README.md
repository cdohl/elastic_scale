# elastic_scale

Use of a 3d printer and a simple kitchen scale to measure the elastic modulus of a soft solid

The reaction force of the solid is measured with the scale.  

The readout speed with an HX711 is about 94Hz.

The movements of the 3d printer z-axis is controlled with the jupyter notebook.
